## Assignment Details

### Objective
This assignment challenges you to apply and interpret Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Precision-Recall Curves (PRC) for model selection in a multi-class, complex classification environment. You will compare a diverse set of classifiers, including those known to perform poorly, requiring careful analysis of the curves rather than relying solely on simple accuracy.
